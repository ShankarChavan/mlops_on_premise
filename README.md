# mlops_on_premise
This repo will be use to setup ml-ops on-premise for an existing ML project

This branch prototype will be used to showcase the normal prototype stage of model building using jupyter notebook.

# Space flight price prediction

**Scenario**: It is 2160 and the space tourism industry is booming. Globally, thousands of space shuttle companies take tourists to the Moon and back. You have been able to source amenities offered in each space shuttle, customer reviews and company information.

**Project**: You want to construct a model that predicts the price for each trip to the Moon and the corresponding return flight.

- All required data files are placed in the data folder of this branch
- Following are the files present:
    - companies.csv
    - reviews.csv
    - shuttles.csv
- We will be using Linear regression model to predict the price of spaceflight shuttle.

Note: R^2 for the model built is not that great but the goal of this repo is demonstrate the process of building ML-Ops for existing project.So we will continue with whatever R^2 we had got.
